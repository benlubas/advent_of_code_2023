# Part 1
## Idea

pad the start and end with space
`/\d` to get to the next number
mark it
yank it
determine the length
macro to check if a char is a symbol (I think we might want to keep a count and then do a
comparison at the end)
run that macro on each char around the number, using the length in the x axis, if we see no symbols,
replace the number with spaces
loop for every number
remove symbols
join and replace whitespace with + to sum them

## Steps


## result
1169367 - too high
